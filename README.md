# Mini Proxy - A Guide to What It Is and How to Use It
Mini Proxy is a light, open-source web application that facilitates anonymous web browsing. It serves as a mediator between the user (the client) and the internet. When a user sends a request via Mini Proxy, it forwards the request to the internet, retrieves the response, and delivers it back to the user.

## Key Features of Mini Proxy

#### 1. Compatible with Mac
[Mini Proxy](https://www.okeyproxy.com/proxy/how-to-use-mini-proxy-a-solution-for-web-navigation/?link=b63b57) is designed to work seamlessly on Mac devices, overcoming the common issue where VPN applications may not run properly. The developers have created an algorithm that bypasses Mac device settings, ensuring the program is not restricted on these devices.

#### 2. Open Source
As an open-source tool, Mini Proxy allows developers to modify and customize it according to their specific needs.

#### 3. Privacy Maintenance
Mini Proxy hides the user's IP address, ensuring that their online activities remain private and anonymous.
